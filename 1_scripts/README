The scripts were developed by Zhenzhen Yang from Claude dePamphilis' lab. If you have any questions on using these scripts, please contact
Zhenzhen Yang at yangzhenzhen1988@gmail.com.

These scripts are used to screen large-scale phylogenetic trees for HGT events. We were only screening for HGT from distantly related groups
to the focal taxa. In our case, the focal taxa belongs to the asterid group in which sequenced genomes are quite few. Thus, our scripts 
were designed to screen for HGT from two donor groups (monocots and rosids) into parasitic Orobanchaceae. The scripts defined four groups, 
parasitic plants, rosid, asterid, and others. Based on the taxa used in the tree, the user may need to edit the script for his/her own purpose.

To run the script, for instance, to identify HGT from rosids to parasites using a stringent approach, simply call it by "python get_HGT_from_
rosids2parasites_strigent2nodes.py tree_dir". "tree_dir" is the input directory that contains many trees that follow a pattern of "RAxML_bipartitions.23" 
(for instance, a digit orthogroup number has to follow 'RaxML_bipartitions.'). The user may edit the script for his/her own interest in a way that matches
the pattern of the tree input file. 

The output will produce an output that prints onto the screen, and the user can append "> out.txt" to look into the content of the output. The user can easily
extract the orthogroup number from the output and extract corresponding trees to verify with additional procedures.
